# CODTECH-ML-INTERNSHIP-TASK-2

This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of customer reviews using TF-IDF vectorization and machine learning models like Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree.

Features-
1. Cleans and preprocesses customer review text

2. Transforms text into numerical features using TF-IDF

3. Trains and evaluates three ML models

4. Compares model performance using an accuracy bar chart

5. Predicts sentiment (or location-based label) for new input reviews
